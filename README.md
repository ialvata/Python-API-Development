## Pre-Commit Hooks
- Black:Python code formatter. Character line length optimised for my screen.
- Pylint: Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
- isort: Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type.
