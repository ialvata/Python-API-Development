This will be my interpretation of the Python API Development 20h course from Sanjeev Thiyagarajan on Youtube. :)

## Pre-Commit Hooks
- Black:Python code formatter. Character line length optimised for my screen.
- Pylint: Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
- isort: Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type.

## Pytest
- One thing that could be improved was leaving the pytest tests until the end... In my opinion, Sanjeev should have introduced the tests much earlier, and as he created the new methods, or operations, he could have explained a bit how to create useful tests.
