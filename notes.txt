Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment, when we add our first package.
Activating Poetry virtual environment:
    source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate

Also, it seems that $PYTHONPATH is empty, when using Poetry.
So, cd to the root level of this project directory and do:
    export PYTHONPATH=$PWD

Without this, you'll get `module not found` error messages.

Activating our server app:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
