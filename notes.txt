After some trial and errors... Poetry is really not suitable/easy to manage the virtual env,
so..
First create a venv:
    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

In your venv bin/activate script, add the following line:
    PYTHONPATH="/path/to/root/level"
    export PYTHONPATH

Now activate it, and install poetry inside the venv.
Do:
    poetry install
or
    poetry add <package>

After installing pytest, we may need to deactivate the venv and reactivate it again.
    deactivate && source .env/bin/activate
or just close VSCode and open it again.

To install psycopg2, we first install:
    sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev

Activating our server app:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
